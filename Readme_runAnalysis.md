# My script "run_analysis.R" contains 5 big parts:

#### 1st: Setting the working directory and installing & calling the libraries I use
#### 2nd: Reading all the text files that feed my analysis and extract functions of my interest (average and standard deviation)
#### 3rd: Re-naming variables and building complete data set
#### 4th: Preparing table to be able to perform a correct mean output by subject and activity label with melt and dcast functions
#### 5th: Writing table in ".txt" format
